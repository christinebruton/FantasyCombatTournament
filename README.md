Fantasy Combat Tournament

This is a text-based game to run a fantasy combat game between 2 teams of fighters. 


This game is a one-user-two-player game, so one user should be able to play setup fighters for both teams. For simplicity, we will call the order of fighters in each team “lineup”, like a batting order in baseball or softball.

The flow of gameplay is as follows:


After the user supplied the lineup of fighters in order, for Team No.1, and Team No.2, the tournament starts. In the tournament, the fighter at the head/front of each lineup will battle. The winner of each fight gets put at the back of their lineup, while loser goes to the top of the loser container.

If a fighter won, it may have taken damage, so the game restores some percentage of the damage they took when they get back in line.


The tournament finishes when one of the team does not have any more fighters to fight. When the game ends, it prints the result of the game, and allows the user to have the choice to display the contents of the loser pile. More information is shown below in the menu section
